# Generative Adversarial Networks

## Introduction
**Generative adversarial networks**(GANs) are a recent innovation(2014) in machine learning invented by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues. Given a training set, a neural network will learn to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set.
For example, GANs can use a training set of photographs of human faces to create images of human faces. These generated images don't belong to any real person.

### How do GANs work?
GANs consist of two neural networks that contest with each other. The generative network generates plausible candidates while the discriminative network evaluates candidates by distinguishing the generator's fake data from real data.
