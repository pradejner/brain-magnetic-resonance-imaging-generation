## Measuring Results
In GANs, the generator and the discriminator measure how well they are doing relative to each other. For example, we measure how the generator is fooling the discriminator and how well the discriminator identifies data instances as real or fake. These metrics do not measure image quality or its diversity.

### Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID)
The **Frechet Inception Distance score**, or FID for short, is a metric that calculates the distance between feature vectors calculated for real and generated images.

Lower FID score indicates the two groups are more similar or have more similar statistics. The perfect score would be 0.0 indicating that the two groups of images are identical. FID scores are used to evaluate the quiality of images generated by GANs and lower scores have been shown to correlate well with higher quality images.
