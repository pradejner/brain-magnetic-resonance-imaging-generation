## Measuring Results
In GANs, the generator and the discriminator measure how well they are doing relative to each other. For example, we measure how the generator is fooling the discriminator and how well the discriminator identifies data instances as real or fake. These metrics do not measure image quality or its diversity.

### Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID)
The **Frechet Inception Distance score**, or FID for short, is a metric that calculates the distance between feature vectors calculated for real and generated images.

Lower FID score indicates the two groups are more similar or have more similar statistics. The perfect score would be 0.0 indicating that the two groups of images are identical. FID scores are used to evaluate the quality of images generated by GANs and lower scores have been shown to correlate well with higher quality images.

#### History of FID
FID scores were proposed in 2017 by Martin Heusel, et al. in ["GANs Trained by a Two Time-Scale Update Rule Converge to a Local Nash Equilibrium"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08500 "GANs Trained by a Two Time-Scale Update Rule Converge to a Local Nash Equilibrium").

FID scores was proposed as an improvement over the existing Inception Score(IS) since the Inception Score did not capture how synthetic images compared to real images. Heusel et al. showed how lower FID scores correlate with better-quality images when systematic distortions were applied such as blur and random noise:
